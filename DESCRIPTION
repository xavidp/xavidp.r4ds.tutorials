Description: Tutorials for R for Data Science by Hadley Wickham, Mine
  Ã‡etinkaya-Rundel, and Garrett Grolemund. In an ideal world, students would
  read the book and type in all the associated R commands themselves. Sadly,
  that often does not happen. These tutorials allow students to demonstrate
  (and their instructors to be sure) that all work has been completed. See the
  tutorial.helpers package for a background discussion of the tool and approach.
