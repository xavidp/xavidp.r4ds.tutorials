<!-- This tutorial currently does not follow Chapter 1 at all. Instead, it just uses the material from the old Visualization Overview tutorial. Let's fix this. -->

<!-- Would be good to add more hints. -->

<!-- 1. Get rid of the primer.data package. -->

<!-- 2. No real need to create a bunch of specific tibbles in the set up code chunk. -->

<!-- 3. Make the sections match the sections in the chapter, even if we include a lot of extra material in addition to the code in the book. -->

<!-- Get rid of ggthemes. It no longer maintained. Just use the built in options. -->


## Introduction
### 

This tutorial covers [Chapter 1: Introduction](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/intro.html) from [*R for Data Science (2e)*](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/) by Hadley Wickham, Mine Ã‡etinkaya-Rundel, and Garrett Grolemund. To be fair, that chapter has very little R code. So, in the spirit of getting started, we include some of our own.



## Looking at data
### 

Let's practice the basic terminology and syntax of using R in [Rstudio](https://www.rstudio.com/). Commands like `print()`, `glimpse()` and `summary()` are useful for looking at data.

### Exercise 1

Before you start doing data science, you must load the packages you are going to use. In the code chunk below, use the function `library()` to load the **tidyverse** package.

```{r looking-at-data-1, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r looking-at-data-1-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

### 

The **[tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/)** is a collection of R packages used by data scientists and maintained by [Posit](https://posit.co/), a company formerly known as RStudio. 

### Exercise 2

We almost always use the **tidyverse** package because it contains several libraries with dozens of useful functions. Other packages are used less often. In the code chunk below, load the **primer.data** package.

```{r looking-at-data-2, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r looking-at-data-2-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
library(...)
```

### 

Note that, for historical reasons, we refer to R packages like **primer.data** as *packages* most commonly, but also as *libraries*. That is the reason why the `library()` function is used to load packages.


### Exercise 3

If you are ever stuck while coding, R has *help pages*. Let's say we want to know what the function `sqrt()` does. Open the help page for `sqrt()` by typing `?sqrt` below.

```{r looking-at-data-3, exercise = TRUE}

```

### 

You can also use the `?` to open the help page for a data set. 

### Exercise 4

Type `?trains` to look up the help page for the `trains` tibble from the **primer.data** package.

```{r looking-at-data-4, exercise = TRUE}

```

Copy/paste the Description from the help page into the box below.

```{r looking-at-data-4-b}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 3)
```

### 

You can find help about an entire package with `help(package = "primer.data")`. It is confusing, but unavoidable, that package names are sometimes unquoted, as in `library(primer.data)`, and sometimes quoted, as in `help(package = "primer.data")`. If one does not work, try the other.

### Exercise 5

Assign the value of `sqrt(144)` to the variable `results`. Remember to use the assignment operator `<-`.

```{r looking-at-data-5, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r looking-at-data-5-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
results <- sqrt(144)
```

### 

Although there are [two additional assignment operators](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/assignOps.html), you should use `<-`. 

### Exercise 6

Data frames, also referred to as "tibbles", are spreadsheet-type data sets. 

### 

In data science, it's always a good idea to explore the data before you use it. You can simply examine a data set by typing its name. Let's examine the contents of `trains` data set. Type `trains` in the line below.

```{r looking-at-data-6, exercise = TRUE}

```

### 

In tibbles, column headers are referred to as **variables** and each row of data is referred to as an **observation**.


### Exercise 7

When we type the name of a tibble in the R Console, we are implicitly using the `print()` function. Try it by using `print()` on `trains`.

```{r looking-at-data-7, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r looking-at-data-7-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
print(trains)
```

This produces the same result as just typing `trains`. But `print()` is more flexible, allowing us to specify different numbers of rows and columns.

### Exercise 8

Print out the first three rows of `trains`.

```{r looking-at-data-8, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r looking-at-data-8-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
print(trains, n = 3)
```

### 

Use the `width` argument to change how many columns appear. `print(trains, n = Inf, width = Inf)` will cause everything to be printed.


### Exercise 9

Now use `glimpse()` to look at the `trains` data set. To learn more about the `glimpse()` function, run `?glimpse`.

```{r looking-at-data-9, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r looking-at-data-9-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
glimpse(trains)
```

### 

`glimpse()` displays columns running down the page and the data running across across. Note how the "type" of each variable is listed next to the variable name. For example, `gender` is listed as `<chr>`, meaning that it is a character variable.

`view()` is another useful function, but, because it is interactive, we can't use it within a tutorial. 

### Exercise 10

Run `summary()` on `trains`.

```{r looking-at-data-10, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r looking-at-data-10-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
summary(...)
```

### 

For each variable, the `summary()` function produces summary statistics about that variable.

### Exercise 11

*Code comments* are text placed after a `#` symbol. Nothing will be run after a `#` symbol, which is useful if you want to write human readable comments in your code.

### 

Press Run Code. Afterwards, add the `#` and re-run the chunk. You should no longer see a result.

```{r looking-at-data-11, exercise = TRUE}
sqrt(144)
```

## Basic plots
### 

Let's create the following scatterplot from the `mpg` dataset, which provides measurements of attributes from various car models.

```{r scat-p}
scat_p <- ggplot(data = mpg, 
                 mapping = aes(x = displ, 
                               y = hwy)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5, color = "steelblue") +
  labs(title = "Measurements for Engine Displacement and Highway Fuel Efficiency of Select Car Models",
       subtitle = "Cars with greater engineer displacement are less fuel efficient",
        x = "Engine Displacement (L)",
        y = "Highway Efficiency (mpg)", 
       caption = "EPA (2008)")

scat_p
```

### Exercise 1

First, let's `glimpse()` the data set used above called `mpg`. Looking at the axis titles, can you determine what the names are for the two variables we will use?

```{r basic-plots-1, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r basic-plots-1-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
glimpse(...)
```

### 

`glimpse()` is most effective when you want to see both all the variables of a data set and many observations.

We are going to use `displ` and `hwy` to create this plot.

### Exercise 2

Within `ggplot()`, set `data` to `mpg`.

```{r basic-plots-2, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r basic-plots-2-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
ggplot(data = ...)
```

<!-- Maybe mention default arguments here or somewhere else in the tutorial -->

### 

`ggplot()` initializes a ggplot object. Your output should be an empty canvas.

### Exercise 3

<!-- DK: This step goes to fast. Don't forget, this is the first plot that students have ever made. Go slower! -->

Now, map `displ` to the x-axis and `hwy` to the y-axis.

```{r basic-plots-3, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick="transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r basic-plots-3-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
ggplot(data = ..., 
       mapping = aes(
         x = ...,
         y = ...))
```

### 

Anything included in `aes()` brings some information from the data in our tibble onto the graph. Elsewhere in `ggplot()` and its layers, we change the appearance of the graph without using information from our data.

### Exercise 4

Let's now add the layer `geom_point()`.

```{r basic-plots-4, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick="transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r basic-plots-4-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
Remember when you add a layer you use +. 
```

```{r basic-plots-4-hint-2, eval = FALSE}
ggplot(data = ..., 
       mapping = aes(
         x = ...,
         y = ...)) +
  geom_point()
```

### 

`geom_*` functions (such as `geom_point()`) add ggplot objects aadditional layers to the base ggplot. This allows us to create a graphic piece-by-piece.

### Exercise 5

The following code uses the `mpg` tibble to create a scatterplot that displays 126 points, however, it visualizes a data set that contains 234 points. Because many points share similar values, this causes individual data points to be hidden behind other points. This is also known as **overplotting.**

One method to fight overplotting is to make each point **semi-transparent**. The code chunk below provides the code used to create the graph above. Change the transparency of the points by setting `alpha` equal to 0.5 within `geom_point()`.

```{r basic-plots-5, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick="transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r basic-plots-5-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
ggplot(data = mpg, 
       mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point(alpha = ...)
```

### 

`alpha` only changes the appearance of the graph and does not add new information from the data. Thus, this argument is within the `geom` and is not nested within an `aes`.

### Exercise 6

Now, also within `geom_point()`, set `color` equal to `"steelblue"`.

```{r basic-plots-6, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick="transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r basic-plots-6-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
ggplot(data = mpg, 
       mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point(alpha = ..., color = "...")
```

### 

R has 657 (built in color names)[https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/sites/default/files/2020-04/colorPaletteCheatsheet.pdf?page=3]. Like `alpha`, `color` is not changing the data so the argument is within `geom`.

### Exercise 7

Now, use `labs()` to add labeling to the graph. Set the `title` to `"Measurements for Engine Displacement and Highway Fuel Efficiency of Select Car Models"` and the `subtitle` to `"Cars with greater enginer displacement are less fuel efficient"`. To label the axes, set `x` to `"Engine Displacement (L)"` and `y` to `"Highway Efficiency (mpg)"`. Set the `caption` to `"EPA (2008)"`.

The caption is generally used to credit a project's sources.

```{r basic-plots-7, exercise = TRUE }

```

<button onclick="transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r basic-plots-7-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
Remember to add a layer with the function labs()
```

```{r basic-plots-7-hint-2, eval = FALSE}
... +
  labs(title = "...",
       subtitle = "...",
       x = "...",
       y = "...",
       caption = "...") 
```

Reminder: This is what our graph should look like.

```{r show-scat-p}
scat_p
```

### 

Related geoms to `geom_point()` include `geom_count()` and `geom_bin2d()`.

### Exercise 8

We can also use `geom_jitter()` to fight overplotting. It plots a scatterplot and then adds a small amount of random noise to each point in the plot.

Let's create the following plot with the `trains` dataset.

```{r basic-plots-8}
jitter_p <- ggplot(data = trains, 
       mapping = aes(x = att_start, 
                     y = att_end, 
                     color = party)) +
  geom_jitter(width = .2) +
  labs(title = "Starting and Ending Attitudes of Participants", 
       subtitle = "Democrats have a wide range of starting and ending attitudes", 
       x = "Starting Attitude", 
       y = "Ending Attitude", 
       caption = "Enos (2014)")

jitter_p
```

### 

To better understand the data, read into the dataset by running `glimpse(trains)`. Take notice of the variable type for `att_start` and `att_end`.

```{r geomjitter-1, exercise = TRUE}

```

### 

They are both of type **num**. Because there are many observations of the same discrete values, overplotting can be anticipated.

`str()` is a similar function to `glimpse()`, which displays the internal **str**ucture of an R object.

### Exercise 9

Run the code below that creates a scatterplot of `trains` with overplotting.

```{r basic-plots-9, exercise = TRUE}
ggplot(data = trains, 
       mapping = aes(x = att_start, 
                     y = att_end)) +
  geom_point()
```

### Exercise 10

Now, let's replace `geom_point()` with `geom_jitter()`. Try running this chunk multiple times. How does the noise affect the plot?

```{r basic-plots-10, exercise = TRUE}
ggplot(data = trains, 
       mapping = aes(x = att_start, 
                     y = att_end)) + 
  geom_point()
```

### Exercise 11

Within `geom_jitter()`, set `width` to `.2` to adjust the amount the points are jittered.

```{r basic-plots-11, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick="transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r basic-plots-11-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
ggplot(data = trains, 
       mapping = aes(x = att_start, 
                     y = att_end)) +
  geom_jitter(width = ...)

```

### Exercise 12

Within `aes()`, set the `color` aesthetic to the `party` variable.

```{r basic-plots-12, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick="transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r basic-plots-12-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
ggplot(data = trains, 
       mapping = aes(x = att_start, 
                     y = att_end, 
                     color = ...)) +
  geom_jitter(width = .2)
```

### Exercise 13

Now use `labs()` to set an appropriate title, subtitle, axes labels, and caption for the graph.

```{r basic-plots-13, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick="transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r basic-plots-13-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... +
  labs(title = "...",
       subtitle = "..."
       x = "...",
       y = "...",
       caption = "...")
```

Here is an example of what the completed graph should look like:

```{r show-jitter-p}
jitter_p
```

### 

Great work! Another way to combat over-plotting is to use `geom_boxplot()`.

## Tidyverse
### 

Although the Tidyverse includes hundreds of commands, the most important are `filter()`, `select()`, `arrange()`, `mutate()`, and `summarize()`. Whenever you face a new problem, try to think about which one of these commands might be a good way to start.

### Exercise 1

We will be working more with the `trains` tibble. Start with the `trains` tibble and then pipe it to `filter(gender == "Male")`.

```{r tidyverse-1, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r tidyverse-1-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
trains |> 
  filter(gender == "Male")
```

### 

Most of the questions in this section will follow this example. You will create a "pipeline" --- a sequence of R commands, separated by the pipe symbol: `|>`. Each command takes a tibble as input and, almost always, produces a tibble as output, which is fed to the next command in the pipeline/


### Exercise 2

Start a pipeline with `trains`, `filter()` to only keep rows in which `gender` is "Female", `party` is "Republican", and `age` is less than 40.

```{r tidyverse-2, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r tidyverse-2-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
trains |> 
  ...(gender == "Female" & 
      ... == "Republican" &
      age < ...)
```

### 

Instead of creating a single criterion with many parts, like with an `&` as above, you can just separate the parts with a comma. See *The Primer* for details.

### Exercise 3

Start with the pipeline we created above. (Note you can use the "Copy previous code" button to insert the code from the previous exercise.) `select()` two variables: `treatment` and `race`.


```{r tidyverse-3, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r tidyverse-3-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
trains |> 
  filter(gender == "Female" & 
         party == "Republican" &
         age < 40) |> 
  select(gender, treatment)
```

### 

The columns are ordered, not by how they appear in the `trains` tibble --- where `treatment` comes first --- but as they are ordered in the call to `select()`.


### Exercise 4

Start a new pipeline with the `trains` tibble. Select all the columns except for `gender`, `liberal`, `party`, and `age`.


```{r tidyverse-4, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r tidyverse-4-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
trains |> 
  select(-gender, .., ..., ...)
```

### 

Using a minus sign is the easiest way to exclude variables when using `select()`. But you could also have just selected the variables that you wanted to keep.

### Exercise 5

Starting with `trains`, `select()` all the variables which appear between `gender` and `age`, inclusive. 

```{r tidyverse-5, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r tidyverse-5-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
trains |> 
  select(...:..)
```

### 

Use a `:` to select a range. Of course, this is only helpful if all the variables you want are grouped together.


### Exercise 6

Pipe `trains` to `select()`, keeping the variables, `treatment`, `gender`, and then everything else. Using the `everything()` function to capture the remaining variables.

```{r tidyverse-6, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r tidyverse-6-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
trains |> 
  select(..., ..., everything())
```

### 

Note how we use "pipe" as a verb in the instructions above. You "pipe" a tibble "into" a function. This works as long as the function follows the Tidyverse conventions. Not all functions do.


### Exercise 7

Pipe `trains` to `select()` and keep only those variables which start with the letter "a".

```{r tidyverse-7, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r tidyverse-7-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
trains |> 
  select(starts_with("..."))
```

### 

The `select()` function is a core part of the Tidyverse, so there are many "tricks" for keeping just the variables we want, in the order in which we want them.

Note the distinction between **tidyverse**, the actual R package, and "Tidyverse", the conceptual universe of related packages, all of which use a similar approach for data science, centered around the use of the `|>`.



### Exercise 8

Pipe `trains` into `select()`, keeping just `treatment`, `gender` and `age`. Continue the pipeline into the `arrange()` function, sorting the tibble so that the youngest participants appear at the top.

```{r tidyverse-8, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r tidyverse-8-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
trains |> 
  ...(treatment, gender, age) |> 
  arrange(...)
```

### 

We could reverse the order by using `arrange(desc(age))`.

### Exercise 9

The `mutate()` function makes it easy to create new variables.

```{r tidyverse-9, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r tidyverse-9-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
trains |> 
  select(gender, ...) |> 
  ...(income_in_thousands = income / 1000)
```

### 

### Exercise 10

The `if_else()` function is often used within a call to `mutate()`. Pipe `trains` to `select()`, keeping only one varable: `age`. Then, use mutate to create a new variable, `old`, which is TRUE if `age` > 50 and FALSE otherwise.

```{r tidyverse-10, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r tidyverse-10-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
trains |> 
  ...(age) |> 
  mutate(old = ...(age > ..., TRUE, ...))
```

### 

The `if_else()` function is part of the Tidyverse, coming from the **dplyr** package. The `ifelse()` function is part of "base" R. We recommend always using `if_else()`.

### Exercise 11

Pipe `trains` to `summarize()`. Create two new variables --- `mn_age` and `sd_age` --- which are the `mean()` and `sd()` of `age`, respectively.

```{r tidyverse-11, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r tidyverse-11-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
trains |> 
  ...(mn_age = ...(age), 
      ... = sd(age))
```

### 

We also could have calculated these values "directly," e.g., `mean(trains$age)`. But doing calculations within a pipe is often more convenient.

### Exercise 12

Use `quantile()` to calculate the the 20% and 80% quantiles of `age` from the `trains` tibble.

```{r tidyverse-12, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r tidyverse-12-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
quantile(trains$..., c(..., 0.8))
```

### 

We can also do this calculation within a pipe, but things get trickier because, unlike with `mean()` or `sd()`, quantile returns a vector of length two.


### Exercise 14

Above, we calculated the average `age` for the entire `trains` tibble. Now, let's do the same calculation for men and women separately. 

Start the pipe with `trains`. Pipe the result to `summarize()` and create a new variable, `avg`, which is the mean age. Set `.by` to `gender`.

```{r tidyverse-14, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r tidyverse-14-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
trains |> 
  ...(avg = mean(...),
      .by = ...)
```


### Exercise 15

Pipe `trains` to `slice_sample()` and select 4 rows at random.

```{r tidyverse-15, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r tidyverse-15-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
trains |> 
  ...(... = 4)
```

### 

`slice()` filters the row numbers which you specify. `slice_sample()` gets random rows, but you need to provide the `n` argument. When confronting a new tibble, it is always a good idea to look at some rows at random. The top of a tibble often looks very different from the rest of it!



## Advanced plots I
### 

Let's begin by making this scatterplot using `geom_point()`.

```{r}
point_p <- nhanes |> 
  drop_na(height, weight) |> 
  filter(survey == 2009) |> 
  ggplot(mapping= aes(x = weight, 
                      y = height)) + 
  geom_point(alpha = .5) +
  geom_smooth(method = "loess", 
              formula = y ~ x, 
              se = TRUE) +
  facet_wrap(~ gender) + 
  theme_bw() +
  labs(title = "The Relationship Between Height and Weight By Gender",
       subtitle = "Weight has a greater positive correlation with height for men \n of common heights than for women of common heights",
       x = "Weight (kg)",
       y = "Height (cm)",
       caption = "Source: National Center for Health Statistics")
 
point_p
```

### Exercise 1

Type `library(tidyverse)` to load up the necessaries libraries.

```{r advanced-plots-i-1, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r advanced-plots-i-1-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

### 

We have already preloaded this package for you, so you won't need to load it in following code chunks. However, when you are making graphs on your own, remember to run `library(tidyverse)`. The tidyverse package contains 8 packages that are essential to plotting, including the **ggplot2** package.

### Exercise 2

Run `?nhanes` to look more in-depth at the `nhanes` dataset. If it doesn't work in your block below, you may need to run it in your console. Remember to load `library(primer.data)`.

```{r advanced-plots-i-2, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r advanced-plots-i-2-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
?nhanes
```

### Exercise 3

In two or three sentences, describe what the `nhanes` dataset is in your own words. Again, you should be able to see the description from `?nhanes`.

```{r advanced-plots-i-3}
  question_text(NULL,
    answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
    allow_retry = TRUE,
    try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
    incorrect = NULL,
    rows = 3)
```

### 

Good! You should see that we are looking at health data across the United States.

### Exercise 4

Run `nhanes` to view the data.

```{r advanced-plots-i-4, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r advanced-plots-i-4-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
nhanes
```

### 

Note how there are many missing values. To form nice graphs with R, we will have to remove those NA values.

### Exercise 5

Start a new pipe with `nhanes`. Use the function `drop_na() `to remove any rows with any missing values for `height` or for `weight`. Within `drop_na()`, you should have put `height, weight`. 

```{r advanced-plots-i-5, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r advanced-plots-i-5-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
nhanes |> 
  drop_na(..., ...)
```

### Exercise 6

Extend your pipe using `|>` and use `filter()` to keep rows where `survey` is equal to 2009.

```{r advanced-plots-i-6, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r advanced-plots-i-6-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
nhanes |> 
  drop_na(height, weight) |> 
  filter(survey == ...)
```

Remember: you must use `==` to check whether something is truly equal. The regular equal sign does not mean the same thing in R as it does in math.

### Exercise 7

Continue your pipe using `|>` and select the columns `height`, `weight`, and `gender`. 

```{r advanced-plots-i-7, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r advanced-plots-i-7-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
nhanes |> 
  drop_na(height, weight) |> 
  filter(survey == ...) |> 
  select(height, weight, gender)
```

### Exercise 8

Extend your pipe using `|>` and add `ggplot()`. Map `weight` to the x-axis and `height` to the y-axis. Remember, this should all be within the `aes` argument within mapping.

```{r advanced-plots-i-8, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r advanced-plots-i-8-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
nhanes |> 
  drop_na(height, weight) |> 
  filter(survey == 2009) |> 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = ..., 
                       y = ... ))
```

### 

If you run your code, you will see a blank plot. The geom layer is key to making sure you have points on your graph.

### Exercise 9

Next, add the layer `geom_point()`.

```{r advanced-plots-i-9, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r advanced-plots-i-9-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
nhanes |> 
  drop_na(height, weight) |> 
  filter(survey == 2009) |> 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = ..., 
                       y = ... )) +
    geom_point()
```

### 

Now, you should be able to see the points on the graph. However, there may still be overplotting. We will rectify this in the next question.

### Exercise 10

Now set the argument `alpha` to `.5` within `geom_point()`.

```{r advanced-plots-i-10, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r advanced-plots-i-10-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
...  + 
  geom_point(alpha = ...)
```

Changing the alpha helps minimize overplotting. The other way to do this is to replace `geom_point()` with `geom_jitter()`. 

### Exercise 11

<!-- DK: Again, this is going too fast. -->

Use `geom_smooth` to add a trendline. 

```{r advanced-plots-i-11, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r advanced-plots-i-11-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
...  +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_smooth()
```

### 

Note how this gives us a warning message. We will rectify this in the following exercises.

### Exercise 12

Set the argument `method` to `"loess"`.

```{r advanced-plots-i-12, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r advanced-plots-i-12-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
...  +
  geom_smooth(method = ...)
```

### 

"loess" creates a trendline that is a curve.

### Exercise 13

Set the argument `formula` to `y ~ x`.

```{r advanced-plots-i-13, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r advanced-plots-i-13-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
...   +
  geom_smooth(method = ...,
              formula = y ~ x)
```

### 

R has already guessed that you want to relate the variable `weight` on the y-axis to the variable `height` on the x-axis. But R does not like to guess. It wants you to specify clearly that this is what you want.  By using formula `y ~ x` as the argument to `formula`, you make it clear that this is the relationship you seek to smooth with `geom_smooth()`.

### Exercise 14

Within `geom_smooth()`, set the argument `se` to `TRUE`.

```{r advanced-plots-i-14, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r advanced-plots-i-14-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
...  +
  geom_smooth(method = ...,
              formula = y ~ x,
              se = TRUE)
```

### 

The shading created by `se` is a measurement of error. Observe how it increases at outlying values for `height`, for which we have few data points. 

### Exercise 15

Use `facet_wrap()` to facet the graph by `gender`. Remember to place a `~` before `gender`.

```{r advanced-plots-i-15, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r advanced-plots-i-15-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
You are adding a layer here so use +
```

```{r advanced-plots-i-15-hint-2, eval = FALSE}
...  +
  facet_wrap(~ gender)
```

Since we only have two graphs, we don't need to specify the number of rows. If you wanted both these graphs on separate rows, you could use the argument `nrows` and set it to `2`. 

### Exercise 16

Change the feel of the graph by adding the layer `theme_bw()`.

```{r advanced-plots-i-16, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r advanced-plots-i-16-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
You are adding a layer here so use +
```

```{r advanced-plots-i-16-hint-2, eval = FALSE}
...  +
  facet_wrap(~ gender) +
  theme_bw()
```

### 

While we use `theme_bw()` in this graph, there are many more options available! You can explore the themes available [here](https://yutannihilation.github.io/allYourFigureAreBelongToUs/ggthemes/).

### Exercise 17

To finish your plot, use `labs()` to give the graph a title, subtitle, axis labels, and caption of your choosing. For an overly long subtitle like the one we have in the example, add `\n` within the quoted string at the place you want to start a new line.

```{r advanced-plots-i-17, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r advanced-plots-i-17-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... +
  labs(title = "...",
       subtitle = "... \n ...",
       x = "...",
       y = "...",
       caption = "...")
```

Reminder: This is what your plot should look like.

```{r show-gp-1}
point_p
```

### 

Good! You've now seen how the `geom_point()` layer can be used in combination with other layers like `geom_smooth()`. We'll explore more usages of `geom_smooth()` with `geom_point()` later in this tutorial. 

## Advanced plots II
### 

Let's make the following dodged bar plot using `geom_bar`.

```{r}
bar_p <- ggplot(data = trains, 
                aes(x = race, fill = line)) +
  geom_bar(aes(y = after_stat(count/sum(count)))) +
  facet_wrap(~treatment) + 
  theme_classic() +
  labs(title = "Starting Attitudes Toward Immigration Issue",
       subtitle = "Higher proportion of minorities among treated participants",
       x = "Race",
       y = "Percentage of Participants",
       fill = "Line",
       caption = "Source: Enos (2014)")
bar_p
```

### Exercise 1

`glimpse` the data set `trains`. 

```{r advanced-plots-ii-1, exercise = TRUE}

```

### Exercise 2

Start a pipe with the `trains` tibble. Select the columns `treatment`, `race`, and `line`. 

```{r advanced-plots-ii-2, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r advanced-plots-ii-2-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
trains |> 
  select(treatment, race, line)
```

Notice that there are 4 unique options for the `race` variable. 

### Exercise 3

Continue your pipe with `ggplot()`. Map the variable `race` to the x-axis within the `aes()` call.

```{r advanced-plots-ii-3, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r advanced-plots-ii-3-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
trains |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = ...))
```

Remember, since we're using `geom_bar()`, we don't need to map something to the `y` axis. R will count the values for us.

### Exercise 4

Before we add a geom layer, map `line` to `fill`. This will allow us to see the difference between each train line.

```{r advanced-plots-ii-4, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r advanced-plots-ii-4-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... |> 
ggplot(aes(x = race, 
           fill = ...))
```

### Exercise 5

Add the layer `geom_bar`. 

```{r advanced-plots-ii-5, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r advanced-plots-ii-5-hint-1, eval = FALSE}

```

### 

### Exercise 6

We want to change the y-axis into a percentage, since the numbers don't really tell us anything. Within `geom_bar()`, nest the function `aes()`.  Within that set `y` equal to `after_stat(count / sum(count))`. Keep track of closing parentheses. 

```{r advanced-plots-ii-6, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r advanced-plots-ii-6-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... +
  geom_bar(aes(y = after_stat(count/sum(count))))
```

### 


`after_stat` is a function used to manipulate variables like `count` which have been calculated by `ggplot()` to plot the graph. 

### Exercise 7

Add the layer `facet_wrap` and facet by the variable `treatment`. 

```{r advanced-plots-ii-7, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r advanced-plots-ii-7-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... + 
  facet_wrap( ~ ...)
```

```{r advanced-plots-ii-7-hint-2, eval = FALSE}
... + 
  facet_wrap( ~treatment)
```

### Exercise 8

Let's add a theme to our graph. Add the layer `theme_classic()` to your code. 

```{r advanced-plots-ii-8, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r advanced-plots-ii-8-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... + 
  theme_classic()
```

### Exercise 9

To finish your plot, use `labs()` to give the graph a title, subtitle, axes labels, legend labels,  and caption of your choosing.

Reminder: This is what your plot should look like.

```{r}
bar_p
```

```{r advanced-plots-ii-9, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r advanced-plots-ii-9-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... +
  labs(..., 
       fill = "...",
       ...)
```
